# GGJ2019
Currently titled "Shadow of the Houses". a small top down 2d action game created in the span of 48 hours During Global Game Jam Vancouver 2019. 

Made by 5 friend (3 programmers and 2 artists) with varying degrees of experience. 

Shadow of the Houses is a titan soul-esque game in which, the player's sole puprose in each level is to own a form of house (to keep to the theme, "What does home mean to you?"). And, following most game logic, in order to own a house you must first defeat it in combat. 

Every level raises in complexity from the last and provides a new challenge for the player to overcome. 

Art style: Pixel Art


At the end of the Game Jam: the first 3 levels were created.
